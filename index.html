            The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
            the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the
            gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The
            vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most
            of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter.

              The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are

              The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being
              composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and
              Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile
              substances with relatively high melting points compared with
              hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.

                The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive
                component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which
                comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces
                temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain
                nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This releases an
                enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as
                electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.
              </p>

              <p>
                Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium at its core, it is a
                main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type
                main-sequence star, where the type designation refers to its
                effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more
                luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of
                the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter
                and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer
                and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the
                stars in the Milky Way.

                Mercury (0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from the Sun) is
                the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet in the Solar
                System (0.055 MEarth), Mercury has no natural satellites. The
                dominant geological features are impact craters or basins with
                ejecta blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity
                including magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupes that were
                probably produced by a period of contraction early in the
                planet's history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of
                solar-wind particles trapped by Mercury's magnetic field, as
                well as atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.[90][91]
                Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been
                adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers
                were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented
                from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.

              Venus (0.7 AU (100 million km; 65 million mi) from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 MEarth) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The planet has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions. A relatively young planetary surface displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity, but is devoid of plate tectonics. It may undergo resurfacing episodes on a time scale of 700 million years.

             Earth (1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi) from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.[99] Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. The planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from solar and cosmic radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining habitability. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.
